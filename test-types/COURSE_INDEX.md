# Type Systems Course - Complete Index

## Course Overview

A comprehensive course on **type systems as a design tool** for writing better software. Using TypeScript as the vehicle, the concepts apply across all OO and FP languages.

**Key Philosophy**: Types are constraints that prevent bugs, reveal intent, and enable fast feedback.

---

## Chapter A: Cohesion
**How types create structure and enforce constraints**

### Concepts
- What is a type? (set of constraints)
- Type systems (rules for assigning and checking types)
- Type inference vs. explicit annotations
- Structural typing (shape-based compatibility)
- Object member checking
- Module scoping and declaration
- Cohesion through types

### Learning Outcomes
- Understand types as constraints, not just syntax
- Know when to use inference vs. explicit annotations
- Recognize structural typing in TypeScript
- See how types create cohesion in code

### Files
- **Explanation**: `chapter-a/README.md`
- **Examples**: `chapter-a/01-basics.test.ts`

### Key Checkpoints 🫵
- A.1: Explain why explicit annotations are better
- A.2: Design a Product type
- A.3: Identify type errors

---

## Chapter B: Coupling & Abstraction
**How typing induces coupling and how abstraction solves it**

### Concepts
- Tight coupling problem (fragile, hard to test)
- Abstraction as decoupling mechanism
- Interfaces as contracts
- Dependency Injection (constructor, method, parameter objects)
- Orthogonality (independence of components)
- Testability through DI (mocks, stubs, fakes)
- Test doubles (mock vs. stub vs. fake)

### Learning Outcomes
- Recognize tight coupling in code
- Use interfaces to decouple from implementations
- Apply Dependency Injection effectively
- Understand how DI enables testing
- Design orthogonal components

### Files
- **Explanation**: `chapter-b/README.md`
- **Examples**: `chapter-b/01-coupling.test.ts`

### Key Checkpoints 🫵
- B.1: Explain tight vs. loose coupling
- B.2: Design a PaymentProcessor abstraction
- B.3: Identify tight coupling in code
- B.4: Refactor to use DI

---

## Chapter C: Strong Typing & Clean Code
**Building expressive, maintainable domain models**

### Concepts
- Primitive Obsession anti-pattern
- Value Objects (immutable, validated, semantic)
- Anemic Objects anti-pattern
- Rich Objects (data + behavior)
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) through types
- Fine-grained vs. broad types
- Restrictive types (prevent invalid states)
- SOLID principles applied

### Learning Outcomes
- Recognize and fix Primitive Obsession
- Design Value Objects with validation
- Avoid Anemic Objects
- Apply SRP to classes
- Use domain types to reveal intent
- Create restrictive types

### Files
- **Explanation**: `chapter-c/README.md`
- **Examples**: `chapter-c/01-value-objects.test.ts`

### Key Checkpoints 🫵
- C.1: Explain why Value Objects are better
- C.2: Design a PhoneNumber Value Object
- C.3: Identify anemic vs. rich objects
- C.4: Apply SRP to a multi-responsibility class

---

## Chapter D: Honest Functions with Types
**Using types to reveal intent and guarantee correctness**

### Concepts
- Pure functions (deterministic, no side effects)
- Input types as contracts (what function expects)
- Output types as promises (what function guarantees)
- Semantic types (encode domain meaning)
- Type-driven function design
- Composability through types
- Honest functions (types tell the truth)
- Function composition and piping

### Learning Outcomes
- Write pure functions
- Design clear input/output types
- Use semantic types for clarity
- Understand type-driven design
- Compose functions safely
- Make functions "honest" about their behavior

### Files
- **Explanation**: `chapter-d/README.md`
- **Examples**: `chapter-d/01-pure-functions.test.ts`

### Key Checkpoints 🫵
- D.1: Explain why pure functions are better
- D.2: Design an honest function for finding users
- D.3: Identify dishonest functions
- D.4: Refactor dishonest functions

---

## Chapter E: Type Safety & Feedback
**Making illegal states unrepresentable**

### Concepts
- Illegal states (states that shouldn't be possible)
- Making illegal states unrepresentable
- Null as a billion-dollar mistake
- Exceptions as anti-pattern
- Option/Maybe type (represents optional values)
- Result/Either type (represents computations that might fail)
- Monads (pattern for composing operations)
- Fast feedback loops (compile-time vs. runtime)
- Type safety benefits

### Learning Outcomes
- Design types that prevent illegal states
- Replace null with Option type
- Replace exceptions with Result type
- Understand monadic operations (map, flatMap)
- Appreciate fast feedback from types
- Recognize type safety benefits

### Files
- **Explanation**: `chapter-e/README.md`
- **Examples**: `chapter-e/01-type-safety.test.ts`

### Key Checkpoints 🫵
- E.1: Explain why illegal states should be unrepresentable
- E.2: Design a payment status type system
- E.3: Compare null, exceptions, and Result types
- E.4: Implement Option and Result helpers

## Learning Path

### Beginner (Chapters A-B)
Start here if you're new to type systems:
1. **Chapter A**: Understand what types are and how they create cohesion
2. **Chapter B**: Learn how abstraction reduces coupling

**Outcome**: You can write loosely coupled code with clear types.

### Intermediate (Chapters C-D)
Continue with domain modeling and function design:
3. **Chapter C**: Design expressive domain types
4. **Chapter D**: Write honest functions with clear contracts

**Outcome**: You can design clean, maintainable code with semantic types.

### Advanced (Chapter E)
Master type safety and error handling:
5. **Chapter E**: Make illegal states unrepresentable

**Outcome**: You can write type-safe code that prevents entire categories of bugs.

## How to Use This Course

### For Self-Study
1. Read the explanation file (`.md`) for each chapter
2. Study the working examples (`.test.ts` files)
3. Run the tests: `npm test -- test-types/chapter-a/`
4. Complete the checkpoints (🫵) to verify understanding
5. Modify examples and experiment

### For Teaching
1. Start with the explanation files as slides/notes
2. Live-code the examples with students
3. Have students complete checkpoints
